# CSharp-PRNG
A Pseudo-random Number Generator in C#

The PRNG logic was found in this [StackOverflow thread](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27778615/pseudo-random-number-generator-c-sharp)

The code was repurposed by me to work as a function to pick a pseudorandom number from a list.

Contains example code to test its functionality.
